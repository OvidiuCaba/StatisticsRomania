        This demo illustrates how to show detailed information about the selected row anywhere outside the grid. 
        This feature is common in many real-live applications. 
        To review how it works, select a data row in the grid and see how the row details appear below the grid.
        When the grid’s selection is changed, the <span class="ident">SelectionChagned</span> event is raised. 
        In this event handler, the bottom panel is refreshed to display field values of the data source record to which the currently selected row corresponds.
