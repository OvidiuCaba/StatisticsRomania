        This example demonstrates one of the GridControl's filtering options - an auto-filter panel. 
        It is an additional grid row that has empty cells by default and is displayed at the top of the grid above all other rows. 
        The main purpose of this row is to provide end-users with a quick and visual way to filter grid data.
    </p>
    <p>
        To see the feature in action, enter a value into any cell of this row. 
        Note that the grid is refreshed and displays only rows that match the entered value in the corresponding column. 
        After a filter has been applied, the filter panel displaying this filter is automatically shown at the bottom of the grid.
