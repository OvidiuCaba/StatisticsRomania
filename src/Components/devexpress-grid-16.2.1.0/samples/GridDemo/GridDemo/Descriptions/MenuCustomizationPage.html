    <p>The GridControl provides a set of built-in popup menus allowing end-users to manage data rows (edit and delete them), sort and group data, show and hide columns, 
    modify total and group summaries. A specific popup menu is invoked for a particular grid element (a data row, group row, column header, and total summary).</p>
    <p>
    You can customize the grid’s popup menus by removing existing items or adding new ones for performing any custom actions. 
    For this purpose, the GridControl provides the <span class="ident">PopupMenuCustomization</span> event. 
    This demo shows how to handle this event, and use its arguments to access and change the grid’s menu items.</p>
